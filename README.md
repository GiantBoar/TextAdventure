# VUORI
_a text based adventure_

VUORI is a text-based adventure made in two months for a university assignment; the assignment was to create a text-based game using C++ and Visual Studio.
Unfortunately, game-wise this project is _horifically unfinished,_ with only a handful of areas and two characters implemented.

## Plot
You were born in a small town in the east of an undisclosed country, with a simple life. One day, a calamity known as **The Rider** travels through your town on the way to **The Mountain**, at the top of which is a shrine which grants the brave pilgrim who reaches it one wish. The Rider slaughtered half the population of the town and spread rot and decay as he came through, leaving you an orphan and your town dying. You venture off after the rider, seeing the destruction The Rider left in its wake and solving the puzzles and hazards of the land.

In the final game, only the introductory cutscene, first level, and woods puzzle are implemented, as well as a traveller you can talk to and an NPC who helps you during the forest puzzle.

## Engine Features
For this assignment, a simple engine was made to support the features of the game, including:
- Json saving / loading
- Dialogue trees and a tool to create them
- Level data creation tool
- Sprite loading from text files & animations
- UI elements and navigation
- User input handling
