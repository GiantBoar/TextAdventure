you choose between one of three warriors to make a grand journey to this big mountain in order to pray at the shrine at the top of it to save your hometown from plague, war, famine and death

You ride your horse to the edge of the ravine, watching as the illustrious greenery and vibrant life that has surrounded your life withers and wilts with proximity to the mountain.
at the very top, there is a shining, holy light

you ride until dusk, but your horse grows weary, and your chest is heavy.
You see a faint glow besides the path further up ahead

It should go:
Journey to the mountain -> Campfire -> mysterious forest -> abandoned town -> base of the mountain -> grand library -> reaching the summit -> the final shrine

Notes about each area:
Journey - the journey to the mountain will be mostly a custscene, with the player choosing their character, setting off on their horse and gaining control when they arrive at the campsite
Campfire - Simple branching text dialogue scene, can potentially end in combat
Forest - maze where you have to input N S E W directional inputs
abandoned town - random enemy encounters + some npcs to talk to
base of the mountain - read a plaque, find the body of an unlocky traveller
grand library - cut if you dont have time lol
the summit - larger fight
the shrine - pray and dialogue with the god, you get one final wish

To Do:
- Double Buffer
- make it so you cant resize
- redo character cards to be tarot cards
