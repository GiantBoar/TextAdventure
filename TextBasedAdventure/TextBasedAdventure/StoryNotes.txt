you choose between one of three warriors to make a grand journey to this big mountain in order to pray at the shrine at the top of it to save your hometown from plague, war, famine and death

You ride your horse to the edge of the ravine, watching as the illustrious greenery and vibrant life that has surrounded your life withers and wilts with proximity to the mountain.
at the very top, there is a shining, holy light

// image of the mountain with the text "Your Journey Begins"

you ride until dusk, but your horse grows weary, and your chest is heavy.
You see a faint glow besides the path further up ahead

It should go:
Journey to the mountain -> Campfire -> mysterious forest -> abandoned town -> base of the mountain -> grand library -> reaching the summit -> the final shrine

Notes about each area:
the journey to the mountain will be mostly a custscene, with the player choosing their character, setting off on their horse and gaining control when they arrive at the campsite
